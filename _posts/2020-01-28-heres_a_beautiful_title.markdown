*What is the most important thing about object oriented programming in Ruby?*

The best and most important thing about OO programming is the ability to interact with other class methods. Not only is it timely, but creates more efficient code by reusing methods within other codes. My favorite method thus far is module methods which lend functionality across classes. 

Essentially we link a parent class to a child class which lends parent functionality to the child class without rewriting code.  Talk about efficiency!

If you are interested in learning more about this click this link [https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Module.html](http://).  As you can see we can also call boolean (true or false) methods on modules. 

Looking forward to learning other ways to create efficient code in class methods.

**Waxing Philosophic on Programming **

*Ruby its everywhere! In your phone ... on your computer ... how will you ever escape! *

Gearing up for the beginning of the Flatiron Part Time Online Program and very excited for the challenges this year has to offer.  Already finding many (which is a more humbling type of excitement), however looking forward to becoming a conditioning queen! 

Flatiron posed the question for me: Why did I choose to go into programming?

Now, while I believe that the answer for this will shift as I gain more knowledge of the capacities of technology I think technology's first and primary purpose is redefining modes of communication. 

What a simple word for an incredibly complex idea such as communication. It encompasses all coded language; verbal and nonverbal.  Branch from here and it becomes even more nested in its cultural and historical background.  The beauty of technology is how it is has opened the world to discovering one another. Granted, it is in human nature to also share its worst parts, but what I am passionate about is using this *tool* of communication to spread the beauty of knowledge and act in empathetic kindness to the projects I choose to work on.  However complex that may be. 

Music and education fall into the realm of enhancing human interactions and community.  The goal by the end of this course is to design and program an application that enhances community interactions and impact through technology as a means to an end and not an end in itself.  If someone can use this application and can question how they view themselves in their community and what kind of impact they are making in a positive way *while* providing a usable tool that will be a worthwhile accomplishment.

Still brainstorming practical applications of this .

Currently interested in the realms of feminism, art, fashion, education, sex positivity across cultural boundaries, US and personal impact on India and Thailand, and mindful global traveling.  I see a need to spread wealth through global community engagement without falling victim to white saviorism and instead bolstering local communities and economies while respecting humanity and culture.

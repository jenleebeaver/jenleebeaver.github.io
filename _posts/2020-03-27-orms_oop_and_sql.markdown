As we continue down our journey of discovering OOP and passed through the learning curves associated with attribute accessors, classes, instances, and linking files I can't help but reflect on how useful object relational mapping or ORMS is.  

This allows us to access a relational database and update new data into a table.  It is a neat, in organization and perception, way to organize and grab data. 

By executing SQL functionality we can iterate through and save new data to a new ID. The ability to do things such as join tables allows the possibility of adding and manipulating new data with associated ID's.  

For example, if we wanted to keep track of a list of potentially succesful start ups and their net worth and associate a table of potential investors for each startup we can join this data and search highest paying investors to a specific start-up.  This is one example of how we can manipulate data.  Using SQL makes these search queries fast and easy.

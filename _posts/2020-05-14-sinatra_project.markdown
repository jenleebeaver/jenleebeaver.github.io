Creative Block Lightning 

My Sinatra project came from the idea to create a blogpost and then randomly generate titles from the content of the blogpost. 

My user is currently able to login/signin and create/update/and destroy a blogpost.  I still have to create a titles controller and erb routes that allow me to grab my blogpost content specific to the blogpost id and generate a table of titles from that content, however the project follows the MVP requirements.

I am also still working on my CSS/HTML to make this more user friendly.

I want to build this out so people can use this when they have writer's block.

I find the most difficult part was keeping my routes and instances organized while the project grows.

I have noticed two things as coding has become a more consistent part of my life.

1) Perserverance in complex problem solving.

and

2) Passive problem solving.

Perserverance was and is something I am still working on in regards to sticking with problems. However, what I find more interesting is unconcious or passive problem solving.  The ability to take a step away from the computer in frustration and then have new clarity over a problem while washing the dishes, making dinner, or sleeping.  This is helpful in maintaining logical thinking during complex problem solving.  Instead of seeing issues as a source of frustration they can rather be a source of clarity.
